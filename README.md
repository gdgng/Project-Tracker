Still work in progress. Fully functional version. Written in Python. Run from the commandline or use 
auto-py-to-exe to make an excutable (Windowss). Still a lot of work to be done. Feel free to use and experiment. 
I had to learn Python for it but with help of Gemin, Co-pilot and Chatgtp it was a start for an inetresting experience. 
To make a Crypto Fear and Greed index with AI is, at the least, an adventure. It gave an insight in how to formulate a 
better prompy. It took a few hours to explain that fear and greed was positioned correctly but the colors where just
wrong and on the wrong side.

If you use the program and make adjustments, please let me know. Woukd like to learn.
